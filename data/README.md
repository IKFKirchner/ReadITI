The `data` folder contains trials performed with one file or one folder. It provides you with an example of the output from `ReadITI`.

You can use these folders to test `ReadITI`.

Use `trial_with_file` if you are working with a single file. Prefer `trial_with_folder` if you want to process several files within a folder.
